<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Tristan Suwito, a first year at the University of Washington. As of right now, my 
   main goal is getting admitted into the Computer Science program. I'm also working 
   on improving my technical skills and exploring my curiousity with programming.
   I really enjoy the problem-solving and logical thinking that comes with computer science—it’s
   both challenging and rewarding.

   Outside of coding, you'll find me drinking Ito En Green Tea and watching anime. I also like to watch basketball, play tennis, and eat yummy food.
   This website is part of a Udemy course I’m taking to further 
   explore the world of programming and its many nuances. I’m excited to continue learning and 
   growing in this field.
